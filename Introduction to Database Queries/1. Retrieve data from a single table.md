 # Retrieve Data from single table
 
 - The basic syntax of the SELECT statement:
 ```sql
SELECT select_list
[FROM table_source]
[WHERE search_condition]
[ORDER BY order_by_list]
[LIMIT row_limit]
```
- A simple SELECT statement:
 ```sql
SELECT * FROM invoices
``` 
- A SELECT statement that retrieves and sorts rows:
 ```sql
SELECT invoice_number, invoice_date, invoice_total
FROM invoices
ORDER BY invoice_total DESC
```
- A SELECT statement that retrieves a calculated value:
 ```sql
SELECT invoice_id, invoice_total, credit_total + payment_total AS total_credits
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_id = 17
```
- A SELECT statement that retrieves all invoices between given dates:
 ```sql
SELECT invoice_number, invoice_date, invoice_total
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2018-06-01' AND '2018-06-30'
ORDER BY invoice_date
```
- A SELECT statement that returns an empty result set:
 ```sql
SELECT invoice_number, invoice_date, invoice_total
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_total > 50000
```
- The expanded syntax of the SELECT clause:
 ```sql
SELECT [ALL|DISTINCT]
          column_specification [[AS] result_column]
       [, column_specification [[AS] result_column]] ...
```      
## Column specifications that use base table values:

- The * is used to retrieve all columns:
 ```sql
SELECT *
```
- Column names are used to retrieve specific columns:
 ```sql
SELECT vendor_name, vendor_city, vendor_state
```
## Column specifications that use calculated values:

- An arithmetic expression that calculates the balance due:
 ```sql
SELECT invoice_total - payment_total – credit_total AS balance_due
```
- A function that returns the full name:
 ```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
```
- A SELECT statement that renames the columns in the result set:
 ```sql
SELECT invoice_number AS "Invoice Number", invoice_date AS Date, invoice_total AS Total
FROM invoices
``` 

 - A SELECT statement that doesn’t name a calculated column:
 ```sql
SELECT invoice_number, invoice_date, invoice_total, invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total 
FROM invoices
 ```==
The arithmetic operators in order of precedence:
```sql
*		Multiplication		1
/		Division			1
DIV 	Integer division	1	
%		Modulo(remainder)	1
+		Addition			2
-		Substraction		2								*/
```
- A SELECT statement that calculates the balance due:
```sql
SELECT invoice_total, payment_total, credit_total,
	   invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total AS balance_due
FROM invoices
``` 
- Use parentheses to control the sequence of operations:
 ```sql
SELECT	invoice_id,
		invoice_id + 7 * 3 AS multiply_first,
		(invoice_id + 7) * 3 AS add_first
FROM invoices
ORDER BY invoice_id
```
- Use the DIV and modulo operators:
```sql
SELECT 	  invoice_id,
          invoice_id / 3 AS decimal_quotient,
          invoice_id DIV 3 AS integer_quotient,
          invoice_id % 3 AS remainder
FROM invoices
ORDER BY invoice_id
```
- The syntax of the CONCAT function:
 ```sql
CONCAT(string1[, string2]...)
```
- How to concatenate string data:
 ```sql
SELECT vendor_city, vendor_state,
       CONCAT(vendor_city, vendor_state)
FROM vendors
```
- How to format string data using literal values:
```sql   
SELECT vendor_name,
		CONCAT(vendor_city, ', ', vendor_state, ' ', vendor_zip_code) AS address
FROM vendors 
```
-  How to include apostrophes in literal values:
```sql
SELECT  CONCAT(vendor_name, '''s Address: ') AS Vendor,
		CONCAT(vendor_city, ', ', vendor_state, ' ', vendor_zip_code) AS Address
FROM vendors
```
- The syntax of the LEFT function:
```sql
LEFT(string, number_of_characters)
```
- A SELECT statement that uses the LEFT function:
 ```sql
SELECT vendor_contact_first_name, vendor_contact_last_name,
       CONCAT(LEFT(vendor_contact_first_name, 1),LEFT(vendor_contact_last_name, 1)) AS initials
FROM vendors 
``` 
- The syntax of the DATE_FORMAT function:
 ```sql
DATE_FORMAT(date, format_string)
```
## A SELECT statement that uses the DATE_FORMAT function:

- To specify the format of a date, you use the percent sign (%) to identify a format code:
```sql
SELECT invoice_date,
      DATE_FORMAT(invoice_date, '%m/%d/%y') AS 'MM/DD/YY',
      DATE_FORMAT(invoice_date, '%e-%b-%Y') AS 'DD-Mon-YYYY'
FROM invoices
ORDER BY invoice_date
``` 
- The syntax of the ROUND function:
```sql    
ROUND(number[, number_of_decimal_places])
```
- A SELECT statement that uses the ROUND function:
```sql    
SELECT invoice_date, invoice_total,
		ROUND(invoice_total) AS nearest_dollar,
		ROUND(invoice_total, 1) AS nearest_dime
FROM invoices
ORDER BY invoice_date
```  
- A SELECT statement that tests a calculation:
```sql   
SELECT 1000 * (1 + .1) AS "10% More Than 1000"
``` 
- A SELECT statement that tests the CONCAT function:
```sql   
SELECT "Ed" AS first_name, "Williams" AS last_name,
       CONCAT(LEFT("Ed", 1), LEFT("Williams", 1)) AS initials
```       
- A SELECT statement that tests the DATE_FORMAT function:
```sql 
SELECT CURRENT_DATE,
    DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%m/%d/%y') AS 'MM/DD/YY',
    DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%e-%b-%Y') AS 'DD-Mon-YYYY'
 ```
- A SELECT statement that returns all rows:
```sql  
SELECT vendor_city, vendor_state
FROM vendors
ORDER BY vendor_city
```
- A SELECT statement that eliminates duplicate rows:
```sql    
SELECT DISTINCT vendor_city, vendor_state
FROM vendors
ORDER BY vendor_city
``` 
- The syntax of the WHERE clause with comparison operators:
```sql 
WHERE expression_1 operator expression_2
```
- The comparison operators:
```sql 
=
<
>
<=
>=
<> 
!=
``` 
 
## Examples of WHERE clauses that retrieve:

- Vendors located in Iowa:
```sql 
WHERE vendor_state = 'IA’
```   
- Invoices with a balance due (two variations):
```sql 
WHERE invoice_total – payment_total – credit_total > 0
WHERE invoice_total > payment_total + credit_total
```
-- Vendors with names from A to L:
```sql    
WHERE vendor_name < 'M’
```
- Invoices on or before a specified date:
```sql 
WHERE invoice_date <= '2018-07-31’
```
- Invoices on or after a specified date:
```sql 
WHERE invoice_date >= '2018-07-01’
```
- Invoices with credits that don’t equal zero (two variations):
```sql 
WHERE credit_total <> 0
WHERE credit_total != 0
```
- The syntax of the WHERE clause with logical operators:
```sql 
WHERE [NOT] search_condition_1
{AND|OR}
	  [NOT] search_condition_2 ...
```      
## Examples of WHERE clauses that use logical operators:

- The AND operator
```sql 
WHERE vendor_state = 'NJ' AND vendor_city = 'Springfield'
```
- The OR operator:
```sql 
WHERE vendor_state = 'NJ' OR vendor_city = 'Pittsburg'
```
-- The NOT operator:
```sql 
WHERE NOT vendor_state = 'CA'
``` 
- The NOT operator in a complex search condition:
```sql 
WHERE NOT (invoice_total >= 5000 OR NOT invoice_date <= '2018-08-01')
 ```  
- The same condition rephrased to eliminate the NOT operator:
```sql 
WHERE invoice_total < 5000
  AND invoice_date <= '2018-08-01'
```  
- A compound condition without parentheses:
```sql 
WHERE invoice_date > '2018-07-03' OR invoice_total > 500
  AND invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total > 0
```
- The same compound condition with parentheses:
```sql 
WHERE (invoice_date > '2018-07-03' OR invoice_total > 500)
  AND invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total > 0
```
- The syntax of the WHERE clause with an IN phrase:
```sql 
WHERE test_expression [NOT] IN
	  ({subquery|expression_1 [expression_2]...})
```
## Examples of the IN phrase:

- An IN phrase with a list of numeric literals:
```sql 
WHERE terms_id IN (1, 3, 4)
```
- An IN phrase preceded by NOT:
```sql 
WHERE vendor_state NOT IN ('CA', 'NV', 'OR')
```

    (SELECT vendor_id
	FROM invoices
	WHERE invoice_date = '2018-07-18')
```

```sql 
WHERE test_expression [NOT] BETWEEN
	  begin_expression AND end_expression
```      
## Examples of the BETWEEN phrase:

```sql     
WHERE invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total
BETWEEN 200 AND 500
```

```sql 
WHERE payment_total
BETWEEN credit_total AND credit_total + 500
```
